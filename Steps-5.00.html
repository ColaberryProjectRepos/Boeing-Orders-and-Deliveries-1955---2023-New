<p><b>Suggestions/Recommendations:</b></p><ol><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">As shown in the data, the decade of the 2020’s had a major decline in both orders and deliveries due to the global economic condition that the world was faced with. The Delivery YoY % declined&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">48.95%</span>&nbsp;compared to previous decades and as for the Order YoY % declined as well to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">3.21%</span>. This being said, a suggestion I would recommend is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of production capacity after the pandemic and align it with market demand forecasts. Identify areas where capacity can be increased through investment in infrastructure, workforce training, or technology upgrades to meet delivery targets.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Throughout the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s, the data shows that the Delivery % has decreased over that time period. The decade of the 1970’s had the Delivery % sitting at&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">95%</span>&nbsp;and within those years it decreased down to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(185, 94, 6);">86%</span>&nbsp;causing a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">9%</span>&nbsp;decline over that time period. Due to this information, I would suggest that Boeing streamlines production processes by evaluating and optimizing Boeing's manufacturing processes to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies that hinder delivery timelines. Implement lean production methodologies and advanced automation techniques to improve productivity and reduce production lead times. Boeing should also have strategic partnerships with airlines and aircraft lessors to promote Boeing aircraft and incentivize orders. Offer customized financing options, leasing programs, or fleet management solutions to facilitate the acquisition of Boeing planes.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">Throughout the 50’s, 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s the data shows that the Total Orders vastly increased as the Boeing manufacturer grew as a business. With that being said, the business struggled pushing out deliveries faster than the orders came in throughout this time period. In the beginning the company started with a Delivery % of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">100%</span>&nbsp;and only 347 orders in the first decade. That quickly increased to over 3000 orders in the next decade with only completing a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">97%</span>&nbsp;Delivery % rate that next decade and slowly declining as the decades went on. With that being said I recommend the Manufacturer instill optimization within the supply chain to improve this percentage. Boeing should be collaborating closely with suppliers and logistics partners to enhance supply chain visibility, efficiency, and coordination. Implement demand-driven supply chain strategies to ensure timely availability of parts and components required for production. I also think that Boeing should foster effective collaboration and communication between various teams involved in the delivery process, including production, supply chain, engineering, and quality control. This will ensure seamless coordination and minimize delays or miscommunications that can impact delivery timelines.&nbsp;</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1327/22/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
